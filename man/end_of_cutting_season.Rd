\title{Last day of cutting season}
\usage{
end_of_cutting_season(min_biomass, elevation, intensity = "high")
}
\arguments{
\item{min_biomass}{float A standing biomass below this value cannot even 
be harvested,}

\item{elevation}{float Altitude in m.a.s.l.}

\item{intensity}{string Management intensity. One of "high", "middle", "low"}
}
\value{
float Last (fractional) day of the year on which a cut still makes 
  sense.
}
\description{
Estimate the last day on which it still makes sense to cut. This is done 
by checking at which point the expected target biomass (see 
`relative_cut_contribution`) goes below the minimally harvestable standing 
biomass.
