- `SLA` Specific Leaf Area in m^2^ per g.

- `pcLAM` Percentage of laminae (number between 0 and 1).

- `ST1` Temperature sum in degree Celsiues days after which the
seasonality function `SEA` starts to decrease from its maximum plateau.
See also [SEA()].

- `ST2` Temperature sum in degree Celsiues days after which the
seasonality function `SEA` has decreased back to its minimum value.
See also [SEA()].

- `maxSEA` Maximum value of the seasonality function [SEA()]

- `minSEA` Minimum value of the seasonality function [SEA()]. Usually,
`minSEA = 1 - (maxSEA - 1)`.

- `maxOMDGV` Maximum organic matter digestability for green vegetative
matter in arbitrary units.

- `minOMDGV` Minimum organic matter digestability for green vegetative
matter in arbitrary units.

- `maxOMDGR` Maximum organic matter digestability for green reproductive
matter in arbitrary units.

- `minOMDGR` Minimum organic matter digestability for green reproductive
matter in arbitrary units.

- `BDGV` Bulk density of green vegetative dry matter in g per m^3^.

- `BDDV` Bulk density of dead vegetative dry matter in g per m^3^.

- `BDGR` Bulk density of green reproductive dry matter in g per m^3^.

- `BDDR` Bulk density of dead reproductive dry matter in g per m^3^.

- `fg_parameter_names` Vector of strings of the variable names of all
vegetation parameters governed by functional group composition.
