- `DOY` day of year in given year

- `Ta` average temperature of given day (Celsius).

- `Tmin` minimum temperature of given day (Celsius).

- `Tmax` maximum temperature of given day (Celsius).

- `precip` precipitation in millimeter per day.

- `rSSD` relative sunshine duration (%) *apparently unused*.

- `SRad` average sunlight irradiance in 1/0.47 J/s/m^2^. In other words, this 
  value will be converted to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in 
  MJ/m^2^ as: `PAR = SRad * 0.47 * 24 * 60 * 60 / 1e6`

- `ET0` evapotranspiration in mm. Currently calculated here. Should be calculated in model from day length.

- `snow` calculated by model.
